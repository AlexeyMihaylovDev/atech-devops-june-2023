# Python debugging using PyCharm

Based on https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2023.1/creating-and-running-your-first-python-project.html

In your PyCharm, let's run the python script located in `python_utils/car.py`.

This app is a simple [class](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) (classes will be discussed later) that represents a car and provides functionalities such as controlling its speed, accelerating etc... 

In the opened terminal type `s` to get the current car speed:

```text
I'm a car!
What should I do? [A]ccelerate, [B]rake, show [O]dometer, or show average [S]peed? s
```

Observe the returned `ZeroDivisionError` runtime exception.

Our motivation is to find what's went wrong.
We'll use the PyCharm debugger to see exactly whatâ€™s happening in our code. 
To start debugging, you have to set some **breakpoints**.
And run the script in debug mode.
